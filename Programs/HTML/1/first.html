IBM has continually shifted its business mix by 
exiting commoditizing markets and focusing on 
higher-value, more profitable markets. This includes 
spinning off printer manufacturer Lexmark in 1991 
and selling off its personal computer (ThinkPad) and 
x86-based server businesses to Lenovo (2005 and 
2014, respectively), and acquiring companies such as 
PwC Consulting ,SPSS, and The Weather Company 
(2016).</font>
